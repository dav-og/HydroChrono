 * @brief Core data types for the component-based wave architecture.
 *
 * Every sea state (regular, irregular long-crested, directional,
 * bimodal) is ultimately represented as a std::vector<WaveComponent>.
 * The types here are purely declarative -- they describe *what* a
 * sea state is, not *how* to evaluate it.
